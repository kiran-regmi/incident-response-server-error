# 🕵️‍♀️ Investigation Summary Report
## 🧩 Task One – Type of Attack & Rationale
### 🔍 Attack Type: Phishing + Malware Infection (Possible Ransomware)
* **Phising:**
The attacker impersonated the company’s HR department, tricking employees into updating their timesheets via a fraudulent email. This social engineering tactic is designed to harvest sensitive credentials.

* **Malware Execution:**
Once the phishing email was acted upon, a malicious payload was likely executed. Symptoms include:
    - Users unable to open Word documents they previously could.
    - Indicates potential ransomware or virus infection.
